This script analyzes the immunization.csv dataset. It performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization.
2. Loads the dataset and cleans the 'ID' column by converting it to numeric and handling missing values.
3. Creates a new identifier 'new_ID' for each record.
4. Converts the 'MINORITY' column to integer type.
5. Fits an ordinary least squares regression model to study the relationship between 'MINORITY' and 'new_ID' and prints the model coefficients.
6. Generates a scatter plot of 'new_ID' versus 'MINORITY' with the regression line overlaid.
7. Calculates the 25th, 50th, and 75th quartiles of the 'ID' column and assigns each record to its respective quartile.
8. Prints the 'ID', 'MINORITY', and 'quartile' columns of the dataframe.
9. Displays the generated plot.

This analysis helps in understanding the distribution and relationship between minority groups and their identifiers within the immunization dataset.

To run the code:

1. Install Python if not already installed.
2. Install required libraries by opening your command prompt and running:
   `
   pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib seaborn numpy
   `
3. Place the immunization.csv file in the data folder relative to your script.
4. Run the script by navigating to the script's directory in the command prompt and executing:
   `
   python beta.py
   `

This will execute the data processing, perform the regression analysis, and display the scatter plot with the regression line.
